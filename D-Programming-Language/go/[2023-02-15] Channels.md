## Contents

 Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, <-.

```go
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
           // assign value to v.
```

(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.)

Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use:

`ch := make(chan int)`

By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

The example code sums the numbers in a slice, distributing the work between two goroutines. Once both goroutines have completed their computation, it calculates the final result.

## Properties

- Channel basics
    - create a channel with make command
        - make(chan int)
    - Send message into channel
        - ch <- val
    - Receive msg from channel
        - val := <- ch
    - Can have multiple senders and receivers
- Restricting data flow
    - Channel can be cast into send-only or receive only versions
        - Send-only: chan <- int
        - Receive-only: <- chan int
- Buffered channels
    - Channels block sender side till receiver is available
    - Block receiver side till message is available
    - Can decouple sender and receiver with buffered channels
        - make(chan int, 50)
    - User buffered channels when send and receiver have asymmetric loading
- For...range loops with channels
    - User to monitor channel and process messages as they arrive
    - Loop exists when channel is closed
- Select statements
    - Allows goroutine to monitor several channels at once
        - Blocks if all channels block
        - If multiple channels receive value simultaneously, behavior is undefined
