### Concepts
Golang uses only `for` for looping. Here are the steps

### How for loop work
There are 5 steps:
1. The initialization initializes and/or declares variables and is executed only once.
2. Then, the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the body of the for loop is executed.
3. The update updates the value of initialization.
4. The condition is evaluated again. The process continues until the condition is false.
5. If the condition is false, the for loop ends.

```go
for initialization; condition; update {
  statement(s)
}
```

### Characteristics
- simpler loops

```go
- for initializer; test ; incrementer {}
- for test{}
- for {}
```

- existing early
    - break
    - continue
    - lables
- looping over collections
    - arrays, slices, maps, strings, channels
    - `for k, v := range collection {}`
