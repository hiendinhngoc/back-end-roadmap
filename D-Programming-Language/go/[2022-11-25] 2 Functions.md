### Concepts
A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing a specific task. At a high level, a function takes an input and returns an output. Function allows you to extract commonly used block of code into a single component. The single most popular Go function is main(), which is used in every independent Go program.

### Properties
- Basic syntax:
  ```go
  func foo() {
    ...
  }
  ```

- Parameters
  - Comma-delimited list of variables and types 
    ```go
    func foo(bar string, baz int)
    ```

  - Parameters of the  same type list type once
    ```go
    func foo(bar, baz int)
    ```

  - When pointers are passed in, the function can change the value in the caller
    - This is always true for data of slices and maps
  - Use variadic parameters to send list of same types in
    - Must be last parameter
    - Received as a slice
    
    ```go
    func foo(bar string, barz ...ing)
    ```
    
- Return values
  - Single return values just list type 
    ```go
    func foo() int
    ```
      
  - Multiple return value list types surrounded by parentheses
    ```go
    fun foo() (int, error)
    ```

    - The (result type, error) paradigm is a very common idiom
  - Can use named return values
    - Initializes returned variable
    - Return using return keyword on its own
  - Can return addresses of local variables
    - Automatically promoted from local memory (stack) to shared memory (heap)
- Anonymous functions
  - Functions don't have names if they are:
    - Immediately invoked
      ```go
      func() {
        ...
      }
      ```

    - Assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function
      ```go
      a := func() {
        ...
      }
      a()
      ```

- Functions as types
  - Can assign functions to variables or use as arguments and return values in functions
  - Type signature is like function signature, with no parameter names
    ```go
    var f func(string, string, int) (int, error)
    ```
 
- Methods
  - Function that executes in context of a type
  - Format
    ```go
    func (g greeter) greet() {
      ...
    }
    ```

  - Receiver can be value or pointer
    - Value receiver gets copy of type
    - Pointer receiver gets pointer to type
