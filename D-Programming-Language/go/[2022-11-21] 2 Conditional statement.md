### Concepts
1. Like most programming languages, Golang borrows several of its control flow syntax from the C-family of languages. In Golang we have the following conditional statements:
  - The if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
  - The if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
  - The if...else if....else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
  - The switch...case statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed
2. Golang also supports a switch statement similar to that found in other languages such as, Php or Java. Switch statements are an alternative way to express lengthy if else comparisons into more readable code based on the state of a variable.
