### Concepts
Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

### Some characteristics
- immutable but can be shadowed
- replaced by the compiler at compile time
    - value must be calculable at compile time
- Name like variables
    - PascalCase for exported constants
    - camelCase for internal constants
- typed constant work like immutable variables
    - can interoperate only with same type
- untyped constants work like literals
    - can interoperate with similar types
- enumerated constants
    - special symbol iota allows related constants to be created easily
    - iota start at 0 in each const block and increments by one
    - watch out of constant values that match zero values for variables
- enumerated expressions
    - operations that can be determined at compile time are allowed
        - arithmetic
        - bitwise operations
        - bitshifting
