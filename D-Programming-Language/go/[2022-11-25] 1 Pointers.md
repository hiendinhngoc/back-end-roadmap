### Concepts
Pointers in Golang is a variable that is used to store the memory address of another variable. Pointers in Golang is also termed as the special variables. The variables are used to store some data at a particular memory address in the system. The memory address is always found in hexadecimal format(starting with 0x like 0xFFAAF etc.).

### Properties
1. Creating pointers
  - Pointer type use an asterisk as a prefix to type pointed to
  - Use the address_of operator (&) to get address of variable
  ```go
    var a = 45
    var s *int = &a
  ```
2. Dereferencing pointers
  - Dereference a pointer by preceding with an asterisk
  - Complex types (eg: structs) are automatically dereferenced
3. Create pointers to objects
  - Can use the address_of operator (&) if value type already exists
    ```go  
        ms := myStruck{ foo: 42}
        p := &ms
    ```
  - use addressof operator before initializer
    ```go
      &myStruct{foo: 42}
    ```
  - Use the new keyword
    - Can't initialize fields at the same time
  - Types with internal poiters
    - All assignment operators in Go are copy operations
    - Slice and maps contain internal pointers, so copies point to same underlying data
