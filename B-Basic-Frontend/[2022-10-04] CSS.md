### what is css ?

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.

- CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. Now letâ€™s try to break the acronym:    
  + Cascading: Falling of Styles
  + Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags
  + Sheets: Writing our style in different documents

### How does CSS actually work?

When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.

- The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).
- It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
- The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images, videos, and even linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.
- The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).
- The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.
- The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).

The following diagram also offers a simple view of the process:

### Why is CSS important :

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

### Pros and cons of CSS ?

#### What are the advantages of CSS?

- Help to Make Spontaneous and Consistent Changes
- Saves Time
- Improve page loading speed
- Make the search engine better crawl your web page
- Device compatibility
- Ability to Re-position

#### What are the advantages of CSS?

- Cross browser issues (CSS works differently on different browsers)
- Vulnerability (It would only require a read/write access to the intended website to override the changes.)
- Confusion due to its many levels
