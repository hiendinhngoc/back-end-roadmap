### Concepts
An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

An operating system is software that enables applications to interact with a computer's hardware. The software that contains the core components of the operating system is called the kernel.

The primary purposes of an Operating System are to enable applications (spftwares) to interact with a computer's hardware and to manage a system's hardware and software resources.

Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, VMS, OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc. Today, Operating systems is found almost in every device like mobile phones, personal computers, mainframe computers, automobiles, TV, Toys etc.

### Components
- OS Kernel
- main part of OS, it facilitates interactions between hardware and software components and performs task scheduling 
- Drivers - small programs that are responsible for interaction with different hardware: keyboard, printer, usb drive etc 
- User Interface - responsible for displaying all those windows, buttons and so on. Based on DirectX/OpenGL from once side, and on some UI Framework from other side (WPF, Windows Forms, WinAPI, HTML, etc) 

### How it works?
Computer CPU knows how to execute commands. But it needs someone to tell him what command to execute. It is the job of Operation System (OS). Whenever you power your computer, it reads first bytes on your Disk Drive, where it expects to see commands that will start Operation System.
