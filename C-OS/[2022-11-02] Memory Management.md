### Concepts
There are serveral defination:
1. Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating the way a software application access computer memory.
2. Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution. 
3. Memory Management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning portions known as blocks to various running programs to optimize the overall performance of the system.
4. Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.
