### Concepts

In the simplest terms, a domain name is the name and address of a website. It comprises 2 parts: Second level domain and Top-level domain.

- **Second level domain**    
This is the major part of a domain. While you register a domain for yourself, the name you choose depending upon the availability is the Second Level Domain.

For example, `colacolac` is the second-level domain of the domain name `www.colacolac.com`.

- **Top-Level Domain**    
The domain extension or top-level domain is the end part of a domain name. In www.colacolac.com, `.com` is the top-level domain (TLD).

### How Does a Domain Name work?

When an internet user enters a domain in the search bar of the browser, the browser then connects to the Domain Name System (DNS).

The Domain Name System is a large network of servers that contain information about the domains and IP addresses. It’s like an address book where domain names are stored with their associated IP addresses.

Upon the browser’s request, DNS servers look for the IP address linked to the requested domain. When the IP address is found, the DNS servers then point the browser to it.
