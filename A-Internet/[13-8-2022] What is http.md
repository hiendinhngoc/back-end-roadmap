## Concepts
- HTTP is a protocol and it is used to load web pages using hypertext links.
- WWW is about communication between clients and servers.
- Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP Responses.
- HTTP requests are the ways internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website, a typical HTTP request contains:
  - HTTP version type
  - a URL
  - an HTTP method
  - HTTP request headers
  - optional HTTP body
- HTTP responses are what web clients(often browsers) receive from an Internet server in answer to an HTTP request. These responses communicate valuable information based on what was asked for in the HTTP request, they often contain:
  - an HTTP status code
  - HTTP response headers
  - optional HTTP body
