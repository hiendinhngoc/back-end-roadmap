## Concepts
- The Internet is simply a wire. Internet is helpful because two computers connected via a wire can comunicate. The special computers which connect directly on the Internet called `servers`.
- Every server has unique internet protocal address or `IP address`. The IP addresses help computers to find each others.
- IP address is useful but it's hard to remember, so people give it name `domain`.

## How it works?
- The personal computers(client) don't connect directly to the Internet but via a service call Internet Service Protocol(ISP).
- Every thing connect directly or indrectly to the Internet has an IP address. To send and receive correct packages to correct destinations we need routers that direct packages to the Internet close to the destination.
